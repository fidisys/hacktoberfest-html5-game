### 2048 Game Rules

*The aim of the game is to create a tile with a value of 2048.*

#### How To Play

- You will begin with a single tile with a value of `2`.
- You will then need to swipe tiles around the grid, aiming to line them up in neighbouring squares.
- Once you have 2 tiles of equal value in adjacent squares on the grid, you can swip them together to combine their values.
- The game then progresses in this fashion from tiles of `2` up to `4`, `8`, `16`, `32` etc. Each time building up two of the same tile.
- Eventually, you will swipe 2 tiles of `1024` and create a tile with a value of `2048`, thus *winning the game!*

> Beware! If fill up every grid on the screen and cannot make anymore combinations, you will lose the game!
